When doing math operations you may need to include the ```<cmath>``` library, it contains a number of useful functions.

One that you may find useful is: std::pow(base, exponent).

     #include<cmath>

     std::pow(base, exponent)
For example:

     //3^5 is equal to std::pow(3, 5)
     std::pow(3, 5)
Also, for the next programming quiz â€¦. M_PI is equivalent to pi.

 #include<cmath>

 //pi is equal to M_PI
M_PI = 3.14159265358979323846
